		"solution": "Recalibrated the mixing head height adjustment mechanism and replaced the worn lift screw assembly with proper positioning stops.",

		"problem": "Our mixer keeps overheating and shutting itself down right in the middle of mixing our pizza dough. It'll work for maybe 20 minutes then just stops with some kind of warning light flashing. We have to wait an hour for it to cool down before we can use it again, which is killing our prep schedule during the lunch rush.",

I'm worried it's going to seize up completely and leave us without our main dough mixer during our busiest weekend.",
		"solution": "Drained and replaced contaminated gear oil and replaced worn intermediate gear bearings in the transmission housing.",

It's shaking so much that ingredients are bouncing out of the bowl and the whole machine is walking across the floor. We've had to move it against the wall so it doesn't slide around.",
