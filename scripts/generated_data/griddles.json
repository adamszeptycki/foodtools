		"problem": "One of the gas control knobs fell completely off and now we can't control that burner section at all. The knob just spins freely when we try to put it back on and there's no way to adjust the flame. We're basically down to three-quarters of our cooking space until this gets fixed.",
		"solution": "Replaced damaged control valve stem and installed new control knob assembly with proper shaft engagement mechanism.",

		"problem": "The whole griddle shakes and vibrates when we're cooking on it, especially when flipping heavy items like burgers. It makes this rattling noise and everything on the surface bounces around. My cooks are afraid something's going to fall apart and they can't work confidently anymore.",
		"solution": "Tightened and reinforced loose mounting brackets and replaced worn vibration dampeners in the support structure.",

		"problem": "The griddle takes forever to cool down after service - even hours later it's still too hot to clean properly. My night cleaning crew keeps getting burned trying to scrub it and we're having to wait until morning to do a proper cleaning. This is messing up our whole cleaning schedule.",
		"solution": "Replaced malfunctioning temperature control solenoid that was keeping gas flowing at low levels and cleaned blocked cooling vents.",

		"problem": "There are these rusty spots appearing all over the griddle plate that keep getting worse no matter how much we clean and oil the surface. Food tastes metallic when it touches those spots and I'm worried about health issues. The rust seems to be coming from underneath somehow.",
		"solution": "Replaced corroded griddle plate with stainless steel upgrade and treated underlying support structure for rust prevention.",

		"problem": "The grease trap underneath is making this awful gurgling sound and occasionally burps up greasy water that splashes everywhere. The smell is horrible and it's happening more often during busy periods. My dishwashers refuse to work near it anymore because of the stench.",
		"solution": "Replaced clogged grease trap assembly and cleaned blocked drain lines, then installed improved venting system to prevent backup pressure.",
