		"problem": "The baking stone in our deck oven has developed several deep cracks and now heats really unevenly - some spots are blazing hot while others barely get warm. My artisan breads are coming out with burnt bottoms in some places and pale spots in others. The stone pieces are also starting to flake off, which is getting into the food.",
		"solution": "Replaced the cracked stone deck with a new refractory stone and reset the support brackets to ensure even heat distribution.",

		"problem": "The flame sensor in our gas deck oven must be dirty or something because it keeps thinking there's no flame when there clearly is one. The oven will light up fine, burn for maybe ten minutes, then suddenly shut off all the gas even though I can see the flame is still going strong. My bread baker is going nuts because loaves keep getting half-baked when this happens during the middle of a baking cycle.",
		"solution": "Cleaned the flame sensor thoroughly to remove carbon buildup and soot deposits that were preventing proper flame detection, then calibrated the sensor sensitivity.",

		"problem": "Our combi oven's water pump for the steam system died completely - when I try to use any steam functions, I can hear it trying to work but no water is moving at all. The pump makes this grinding noise for a few seconds then gives up. Without steam, I can't do proper bread baking or vegetable steaming, which cuts out about half of my menu options.",
