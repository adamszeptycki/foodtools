It's making everyone in the kitchen nervous, and we're afraid to keep using it but we can't shut down our whole fry operation. The smell seems to get stronger when the fryer is running at full heat.",
		"solution": "Located and repaired multiple small gas leaks at threaded connections and replaced the deteriorated gas supply line with new flexible connector meeting current safety codes.",

We haven't been able to change the oil in three days because we can't get the old stuff out. The oil is getting darker and nastier by the hour, and I know it's affecting the taste of everything we're cooking.",
		"solution": "Removed the seized drain valve assembly and replaced it with a new ball valve, also cleared the drain line of accumulated grease buildup.",

We can't maintain steady cooking temperature and our french fries are coming out inconsistent. Some batches are perfect while others are either soggy or burnt because the temperature keeps jumping around.",
		"solution": "Replaced the faulty thermostat control that was cycling incorrectly due to worn contacts and recalibrated the temperature settings.",
