		"problem": "The prewash section isn't working at all - no water comes out when dishes first enter the machine. Everything goes straight to the main wash with all the food scraps still stuck on, so nothing comes out clean. My dishwashers are having to scrape every single plate by hand before loading it.",
		"solution": "Rebuilt prewash pump and replaced clogged manifold to restore proper prewash spray pressure.",

		"problem": "The chemical pumps are going crazy - sometimes no detergent comes out at all, other times it dumps way too much and we get foam everywhere. The inconsistency is driving my staff nuts because they never know if the dishes will actually get clean. We're wasting so much soap when it overdoses.",
		"solution": "Calibrated chemical feed pumps and replaced worn peristaltic pump tubes to ensure consistent detergent dispensing.",

		"problem": "Water is leaking out from under the machine and pooling on the floor - there's a steady drip that's getting worse every day. The floor is always wet and slippery now, and I'm worried someone's going to get hurt. Plus all that water is probably damaging the floor underneath.",
		"solution": "Replaced cracked wash tank drain valve and tightened all pipe connections to eliminate water leakage.",

		"problem": "The final rinse isn't working right - I can tell because all our glasses have terrible water spots and the silverware looks cloudy. Customers are complaining that everything looks dirty even though it just came out of the dishwasher. The rinse aid dispenser seems empty but we just filled it yesterday.",
		"solution": "Replaced malfunctioning rinse aid dispenser pump and adjusted flow rate settings to ensure proper spot-free rinsing.",

		"problem": "The racks keep jamming up on the conveyor track - they'll move halfway through and then just stop, backing up the whole system. My dishwashers have to manually push them through which is dangerous with all the hot water and steam. It happens multiple times every shift now.",
		"solution": "Replaced worn conveyor track guides and lubricated all roller bearings to ensure smooth rack movement through the machine.",

		"problem": "The dishwasher control panel is acting up - sometimes the buttons don't respond when you press them, other times it starts random cycles we didn't select. Yesterday it got stuck on prewash for twenty minutes straight. My staff doesn't trust it anymore and we're losing efficiency trying to figure out what it's actually doing.",
		"solution": "Replaced faulty control board and recalibrated all cycle timing parameters to restore reliable operation.",

I can see dirty dishes coming out that obviously didn't get hit with enough water force. The whole cycle seems sluggish and ineffective.",
		"solution": "Replaced clogged water inlet valve and installed new pressure regulator to ensure adequate water flow and pressure throughout all wash cycles.",
		"parts": [
			"SKU-IV-495627 - Water inlet valve 3/4-inch with solenoid actuator",
			"SKU-PR-382914 - Water pressure regulator with gauge 25-80 PSI range",
